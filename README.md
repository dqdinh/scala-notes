### Functional Programming in Scala
by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason - While this book does not specifically cover Cats,
it is a great introduction to functional programming in Scala in general and covers some
of the abstractions that can be found in Cats.

### Advanced Scala with Cats
by Noel Welsh and Dave Gurnell - The aims of this book are two-fold:
to introduce monads, functors, and other functional programming patterns as a way to structure program design,
and to explain how these concepts are implemented in Cats.
